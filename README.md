# Paintball Game

## Project Overview

This project is a turn-based strategy game called "Paintball Game," implemented in Java. The objective is to eliminate other teams on a rectangular grid map. Each team controls players who can move, attack, and occupy bunkers scattered across the map.

## Game Features

- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Teams take turns to move and attack.
- **Grid Map**: The game takes place on a grid-based map, with bunkers and players.
- **Player Classes**: Three types of players (Red, Green, Blue), each with unique movement and attack abilities.
- **Bunker System**: Bunkers provide strategic advantages and generate coins for player creation.

## Requirements

- **Java Version**: Java 8 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: None.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the Java source files.
  
## Example Gameplay

Once the game starts, you'll be prompted to configure the map dimensions, teams, and bunkers. Teams take turns creating players, moving them across the map, and attacking other teams to eliminate them.

The game ends when only one team remains.
